The **Jeneral-Template-Resolver** allows you to specify templates with placeholder values and replace these placeholders with concrete values provided in dedicated files. This tool reads each line from a placeholder-specific file to generate personalized text outputs.

---

## ✨ Features
- Replace placeholder values in templates effortlessly.
- Supports multiple value files, iterating over each line to populate placeholders.
- Easily manage template variations by providing different value files.

---

## 📜 How It Works

1. **Define Your Template**  
   Specify placeholders within your template, such as `$myPlaceholder$`.

2. **Create a Value File**  
   For each placeholder, create a file with the same name as the placeholder (e.g., `myPlaceholder`), where each line represents a concrete value.

3. **Generate Output**  
   The resolver reads from these files and substitutes each placeholder, line-by-line.

## 🔧 Example

### Single Placeholder

Suppose you have the following **template**:

```plaintext
$p1$ says hello!
```

And a **value file** named `p1` containing:

```plaintext
Alice
Bob
Charlie
```

#### Result
The output will be generated as:

```plaintext
Alice says hello!
Bob says hello!
Charlie says hello!
```
### Multiple Placeholders

If multiple placeholders exist, each placeholder will be replaced in an iterative manner based on its corresponding value file.

Suppose you have the following **template**:

```plaintext
$p1$ says hello to $p2$
```

And a **first value file** named `p1` containing:

```plaintext
Alice
Bob
Charlie
```

And a **second value file** named `p2` containing:

```plaintext
David
Edward
```

#### Result
The output will be generated as:

```plaintext
Alice says hello to David
Alice says hello to Edward
Bob says hello to David
Bob says hello to Edward
Charlie says hello to Edward
```

### Placeholder array values

For a single line of concrete values, you can specify an array of value variations

Suppose you have the following **template**:

```plaintext
My name is $p1[0]$ and I love $p1[1]$
```

And a **value file** named `p1` containing:

```plaintext
Alice|talking to Bob
HTTP web server|being a teapot
```


#### Result
The output will be generated as:

```plaintext
My name is Alice and I love talking to Bob
My name is HTTP web server and I love being a teapot
```

## 📂 File Naming and Placeholder Conventions

- Placeholders in the template must follow the syntax `$placeholderName$`.
- Each placeholder must have an associated file with the same name as the placeholder (without the `$` symbols).
  - **Example**: For `$greeting$`, the file should be named `greeting`.
